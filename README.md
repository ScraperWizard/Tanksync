# Tank Sync 

TankSync is a custom launcher for Tanki Online which combines ability to manage your accounts effectively and doubles as an Anti-Detect browser which allows sharing of accounts. This software does not attempt to harm Tanki Online in any way or form, instead just enhances the experience.

# Why?
In recent years, TO has been very strict with account sharing and many people end up getting blocked (Even if they have not violated the rules) this ruined the experience of the players and effectievely led to the downfall of the game (In our opinion). So we have created a software to bring back the old experience of the game, gone the days where you wake up to a block message and all of your money and effort and years of fun are gone for no good!.

# How?
The software combines many techniques which have been proven to work in order to evade bans, whilst these techniques are not revealed for personal reasons, it is not limited to: proxies, fingerprint spoofing, browser spoofing, similar to techniques deployed by major Anti-Detect browsers, however what specializes us is Network-Level spoofing, as the TO protocol in fact collects data in real-time regarding players.
